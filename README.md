# Arkanoid_Game
In the Arkanoid game, there are four levels to complete. The player wins by breaking all the blocks in each level. However, if all the balls fall off the screen, the player loses the game.
## General
In this Arkanoid game, players navigate a main block at the bottom using the arrow keys. The goal is to break all the blocks on each level to advance. When all blocks are destroyed, the player progresses to the next level. The game ends if all balls fall off the screen, resulting in a loss. If all levels are completed, the player wins the game.

Scores are earned as follows: 5 points for each block hit and 100 points for advancing to a new level. At the end of the game, whether the player wins or loses, the final score is displayed on the screen.
